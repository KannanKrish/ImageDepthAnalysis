# ImageDepthAnalysis Project Guide

# Basic Steps:

First Open the matlab.
Set the path to the source folder.
Here test_upsampling is the code that find the depth of an image.
Open the test_upsampling.m script. Simply double click the code.
test_imgs/art_big.png it takes the black and white of the color image.
test_imgs/view1.png it is color image that is taken as input and it convert to gray(same black and white image).
This process is getting more averacy result.
These are the code accullay do four process.. by taking sampling from the given image..
Three predefined samplings are bicubic, bilinear, nearest, then finally compare the result to our sampling.
Sampling is the process of analying the pixel nearby or the area.


# How to run the code.
1) Make sure the folder name set correctly.
2) In Run button, you see the Run : Our script. Click that it will run the code.
3) It take some time to analayse the pixel and find the depth of the image.
4) The completion take more time.
5) Finally save the results, what ever you want.

# Saving Result:
1) In File menu Save as -> save to png or matlab fig...
2) The running sampling take is shown in the command window.

Thanks guys...... :>)
